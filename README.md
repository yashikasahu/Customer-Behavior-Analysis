# 📊 Retail Customer Behavior & Shopping Trends Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, real-world data analytics workflow used in retail organizations to understand customer behavior, purchasing trends, and revenue drivers.

The goal is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI — and present those insights in a way that supports data-driven decision-making.

This is not a basic visualization project; it follows an end-to-end analytics lifecycle, from data cleaning to executive reporting.

### 🎯 Business Problem Statement

Retail companies often struggle to answer questions like:

Which customers contribute the most revenue?

What purchasing patterns drive repeat sales?

Which product categories perform best over time?

How can customer behavior insights improve marketing and sales strategy?

This project aims to analyze customer transactions to uncover behavioral trends, revenue patterns, and actionable insights that a retail business can use to improve performance.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

**Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA

**SQL** – Business queries, customer segmentation, trend analysis

**Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization

**GitHub** – Version control and portfolio hosting

**Gamma AI** – Executive-style presentation deck

###🔄 Project Workflow

**1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)**

Loaded raw retail transaction data

Handled missing values and inconsistent entries

Standardized categorical fields

Created derived features for analysis (e.g., customer segments, order metrics)

**2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed customer demographics and purchasing behavior

Identified trends in order frequency and revenue contribution

Detected high-performing and underperforming product categories

**5️⃣ Reporting & Presentation**

Created a structured project report documenting:

Problem statement

Methodology

Key insights

Business recommendations

Built an executive presentation summarizing insights and actions

**📈 Key Insights (Sample)**

A small segment of repeat customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue

Certain product categories consistently outperform others across time periods

Customer purchasing behavior varies significantly by demographics and order frequency

Targeted strategies for loyal customers can improve overall revenue retention

(Exact insights may vary based on analysis results.)

**💡 Business Recommendations**

Focus marketing efforts on high-value and repeat customers

Optimize inventory for top-performing categories

Use behavioral insights to design targeted promotions

Monitor declining categories to reduce losses or reposition products
